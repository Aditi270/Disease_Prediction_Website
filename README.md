# Disease_Prediction_Website
This Git repo hosts a Disease Prediction Website using ML models &amp; Streamlit. Predicts Parkinson's, Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, &amp; Diabetes using SVM, Random Forest, CNN, &amp; XGBoost algorithms. User-friendly, secure, &amp; adaptable. Empowers users for proactive health decisions.
The web application built with Streamlit boasts an intuitive user interface that simplifies the input of medical data for predictions.Heart disease prediction incorporates a deep neural network architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN), which effectively processes cardiovascular risk factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and ECG data. Diabetes prediction, on the other hand, employs a gradient boosting algorithm, XGBoost, to analyze a multitude of features encompassing blood glucose levels, family history, and lifestyle factors.Parkinson's disease, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is employed, utilizing features such as tremor analysis and voice characteristics. Breast cancer prediction utilizes a Random Forest algorithm,
